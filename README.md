# FoodParent
_FoodParent_ is a web-based application as a part of Concrete Jungleâ€™s _FoodParent_ project. The project helps to create virtual connection between trees and citizens who can provide status of fruits in Atlanta. The application provides a tool for creating a connection between trees and people by posting status notes via smart devices and tracking history of trees over years to help Concrete Jungle decide the proper time for foraging fruits and distribute to the needy.
